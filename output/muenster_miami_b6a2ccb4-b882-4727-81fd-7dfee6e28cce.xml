                    <abstract lang="eng">Not more than 30 years ago, hiring a consultant was seen by many top executives - not only in the chemical industry - as a sign of “weakness” or of “not being able to cope on my own”. Today, all chemical companies use the knowhow, expertise, innovative strength and manpower of consulting firms to solve their strategic and operational problems, to reduce complexity, to initiate change processes and to develop the company to new levels. And the smarter ones use Business Coaching as a tool to support the executives themselves to cope with the increased demands on flexibility, the endless stream of information and projects generated in fast changing global markets. Highly individualized - provided by experienced and coaching-trained professional managers themselves - Business Coaching turns out to be a very effective tool to support top-executives in the chemical industry. However, it is important that these top-executives work together with Business Coaches, who not only have a deep understanding of the behavioral aspects of a successful manager, but, in addition, have an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the true business and industry issues the manager in the chemical industry is confronted with. In this article three typical questions, managers from the chemical industry have raised, are used to describe the coaching process with its 4 steps, to elaborate on the differences between “Coaching” and “Business Coaching” and to explain – based on practical experience - how a manager can and will benefit from Business Coaching.</abstract>
